    <h1>LateX template for project report, summaries or assignments üìù</h1>
    <h2>Custom margins, spaces, sections and references</h2>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>I created this template to make a report using LateX easily and quickly. Most of the templates I found online are rather complicated, over decorated, focused for two columns and hard to change. I needed an uncomplicated template to easily make my school/ college assignments/ reports or paper summaries.</p>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>To change the margin, change the following code as per your convenience.</p>
    <code>left=1.2in,</code>
    <code>right=1.2in,</code>
    <code>top=0.4in,</code>
    <code>bottom=0.7in,</code></br>
    <p>To change the paper height use the following code</p>
    <code>paperheight=11in,</code></br>
    <p>To change the paper width use the following code</p>
    <code>paperwidth=8.5in,</code></br>
    <p>To add the date, delete the followng code</p>
    <code>\date{\vspace{-5ex}}</code></br>
    <p>You can add new sections, add new items in the references, delete the references, as per your convenience.</p>
